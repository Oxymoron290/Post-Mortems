# ⛑️ Help

**During any incident our priorities are as follows:**
1) Restore business functionality
2) Learn from any mistakes made

**Avoid assigning blame during any incident, this is counter-productive and does not serve to move the the business forward in any way.**

When facing an incident, it's important to breath and keep your bearings. Remember the [OODA loop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OODA_loop).

- Observe
  - Take inventory of the situation and take all reports & concerns seriously.
- Orient
  - Determine the relationship between the systems to put yourself in a position to grasp the situation.
- Decide
  - As a team, come to a decision over what the best course of action.
- Act
  - Execute on that decision.

Rinse and repeat until the situation is resolved.

- Keep an up to date time line of events. This information will be valuable after the incidents resolution to help make decisions to improve reactions or prevent future incidents.

- Note down steps you've already taken and what their outcomes were.

- If time allows, go ahead and make a copy of the [template](./template.md). Keep it up to date with the incident you are currently facing. Obviously not all of the information necessary to complete a report will be available at this point, but it will help record valuable information and prevent it from being lost.
