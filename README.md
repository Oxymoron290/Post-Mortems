# ‚ö∞Ô∏è Post-Mortem üßü

‚ò†Ô∏è The morgue where autopsies are performed.

## Overview

This repository is a collection of post-mortem analyses to help document incidents during and after when the incident takes place. The main goal of the reports found in this repository is not to place blame on any individual contributor, but to highlight avoidiable mistakes, lessons learned, and identify ways to improve cooperation between team members. It is not a witch hunt, but rather a method to help us improve as a team.

As post-mortems are drafted, they can be tracked in this repository. Once a report has been finalized it can be moved into the [Company Knowledgebase](https://example.com) or a more permenant documentation source.

## How to contribute

You may place whatever resources and documents in this repository that you wish. I myself will be using [MarkDown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) to document my reports with images and supporting resources placed in the [resources](./resources) folder. If your report consists more of a single page, consider giving it it's own folder.

## Format

If you choose to document your reports in MarkDown similar to the way I do it, I have provided a [template](./template.md) which you are welcome to copy and use. Please give your report a name that starts with the date, followed by no more than 3 to 5 word title. (e.g. `MM_DD_YYYY-The-Incident-Of-The-Month.md`)
